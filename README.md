# hello-world
hello-world is my first repository.  I've created this repository as a way to become familiar using GitHub.

I am currently an environmental scientist looking to learn more about the technology space and actively learning html and python.  I hope one day I can use the skills I've acquired in technology to create something that will make an impact in the environmental industry either in climate change, remediation, or waste management.
